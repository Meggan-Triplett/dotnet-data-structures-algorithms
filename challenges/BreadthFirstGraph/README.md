# Breadth-First Graph
#### *Author: Meggan Triplett*

------------------------------

## Description

**A C# implementation of *breadth-first graph traversal*.**

Breadth-First is a method that takes in a starting vertex and returns a collection of vertices in the order they were visited.


------------------------------

## Methods

| Method | Summary | Big O Time | Big O Space | Example | 
| :----------- | :----------- | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------- |
| BreadthFirst | Returns a list of vertices in the order they were visited in the traversal | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | BreadthFirst(vertex) |

##### Breadth First Whiteboard
*The BreadthFirst method utilizes a queue to traverse through a graph via the adjacency list, adding each neighbor to the returned list*
