# Lecture Notes: Insertion Sort

*Insertion sort* is a type of algorithm that will sort an a intger array, one integer at a time.
Generally the algorithm will sort the integers in the array from least to greatest.
This is done by iterating through the integer array, usually from left to right.

Although great for sorting small sized integer arrays, the same can not be said for lare sized integer arrays.
The space efficiency sits at O(1) due to the need for no new data being instantiated.
However the time efficiency sits at O(n^2) causing an exponential use of time as a result of the input's size.

1. *Introduction of Insertion Sort*
   
        Insertion sort is a simple way of sorting a small sized integer array.
        We use this to organize an integer array from least to greatet without having to use more data. It takes one integer at a time and will place it in the array where the value of
