# Lecture Notes: Merge Sort

*Merge Sort* is a tpe of algorithm that will sort a given integer array.
Generally the algorithm will sort the integers in the array from least to greatest.
The algorithm example given here will consist of two methods.

This is done by splitting the array in half repeatedly until each integer element is seperated on it's own. 
It will then compare the adjacent elements and compare their values, placing them in order.
This merge together and compare will repeat until the whole array is merged back together.
It is helpful to think of each merge that occurs like each split in half that happens earlier on in the algorithm.
